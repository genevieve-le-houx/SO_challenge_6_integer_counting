# Stackoverflow challenge #6: Integer Counter

This is my submission to Stackoverflow challenge #6: Integer Counting

The goal is to count the integer that appears the most times in a list of random integers (ranging from 0 to 999).

My approach is simply using the Counter built-in class in Python. I figured it would be already optimized. 


# Execution
The code is done in Python 3.13.7. Simply run the file ``main.py``. No external librairies needed.
